						<h2>About Me</h2>

						<p>
							"Bravery is not the absence of fear but the ability to continue despite being afraid.
							It is through fear that we become fearless, through weakness that we gain strength, and through hardships that we gain confidence. Ultimately
							that is what builds who we are as people, that is what brings out the best of humanity."
						</p>

						<p>
							I'm just a woman filled with desire and passion wandering the earth letting curiosity guide her.
							I graduated from high school without a plan, I didn't really know what to expect, what to major in, or even if
							I should entertain the idea of college. The only thing I really knew was that I thrived in two core subjects: mathematics and science.
							So, four years later I graduated from the University of Michigan Dearborn with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering
							and a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. Lastly, a certification in software engineering from App Academy,
							as software has become highly prevelant in todays society, basic understanding of principles is not only required but demanded for success.
						</p>

						<p>
							Today I'm a second year graduate student working towards a master's degree in business administration.
							The master’s degree will enhance my skill set and pave way for stronger leadership and critical
							thinking skills. It will strengthen my ability to make tough calls at the right time and manage demanding situations.
							Overall, obtaining an MBA degree will provide a new perspective to business, teams and collaboration. It will certainly
							complement my bachelor’s degree and allow for further amplification of skills that may last a lifetime.
						</p>

						<p>
							As a graduate student AND a woman who loves food, fashion and spontaneity.
							I hope to bring a feminine touch to the masculine field of Engineering.
